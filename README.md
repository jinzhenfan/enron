# enron dataset. Machine learning

Identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to 
widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, there was a significant amount of typically confidential
information entered into public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. 
In this project, we will play detective, and build a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made
public as a result of the Enron scandal.
